# Film Photo DB

## Introduction

The Film Photo DB is a computerized organization tool to keep
track of the metadata and complicated hierarchy of photographic
film and the network of physical and digital products that can
be created from it.

Current digital tools such as EXIF metadata, Adobe Lightroom, and
Darktable do not effectivly manage the intricacies of photographic
film. This database system will fill this gap and be available as
a backend database to other tools.

Currently the project is in early development and is not functional.
